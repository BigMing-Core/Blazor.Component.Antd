# Blazor.Component.Antd
Base on antdv4
This project is in the design phase.
But, you know~ I'm already realization some components, you can clone this project and run project: DevelopmentCode.

This project use tries to use the full WPA design to realization the antd. 

If you same as me, maybe we can build this project together.

Currently, I wish I can finish this job earlier than October.
Yeah~ With.NET5.
Sure I have another job to do, I need the canvas engine with my real job, so if we can work together, I can begin the canvas component as fast as I can.

Thanks for reading.
