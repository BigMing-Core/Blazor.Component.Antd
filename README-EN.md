Our library goal is to use the existing system to make a stable, high-availability Blazor component library. <br/>
We will not synchronize the official CSS and corresponding implementations with other implementations.We are currently locked in antd v4.0.4.
<br/>

### We need a selfless person to help us improve the document warehouse
## About LuanNiao
LuanNiao is the front-end team of a small software company in China. Our company's directions are: OA, ERP, IOT, FPGA customization, MCU development, robots, visual recognition, graphics drawing, GIS, etc., and outsourcing business.
We will also have corresponding WEBGL, CANVAS 2D business content, our current technology stack remains: C, C ++, QT, .NET CORE, Golang, H5, OPENGL, React, Vue. <br/>
The LuanNiao Blazor component library is our team's component library for landing on the actual website business.Our warehouse is not limited to the realization of the function of ANTD, but is developed for the purpose of being actually used in the development website scenario. br />
For specific details, please see the description on the front page of our documentation website, where we have written a lot of reasons for our compromise and the current warehouse design architecture and business flow diagram. <P> </p>

## Announcement
First of all, we guarantee that our warehouse will not charge, which is why we use the MIT protocol. You can clone this warehouse at any time under the background of MIT. <br/>
After a day of discussion between our company and the team, as well as after implementability analysis and cost analysis, we will not beautify the document demonstration website in the future. <br/>
The beautification here refers only to: we will maintain, but we will not write standard-level reading documents. You can see all of our component functions on the documentation website, but we will not typographically layout this. >
Our current development speed is about one new component per day.After the components used in the normal project are completed, there will be a test and testing department to intervene. <br/>
At the same time, our performance optimization is in the development life cycle of the entire component. But we guarantee: our external interface remains consistent. <br/>


# Note

As a project maintained by the company, we do not recommend you to use our warehouse in 2020, we still do not recommend that you use our finished components in the production environment. <br/>
According to the test department's estimate, our test cycle is about 2 ~ 3 months. Of course, this is still when we can complete the development and pass the performance test. <br/>
You can continue to pay attention to this warehouse, we will update our actual project application progress at any time, you can use this as a reference to determine whether to use this warehouse. <br/>
Similarly, if you find that our Release version (> 1.0.0) appears in the Nuget warehouse, you can use it as an enterprise portal-level website. <br/>

## Example
Release frequency 1 / day

## Installation

***There is no release plan at the moment***, the Relase version (available version of the actual project) is about the beginning of 2021 <br/>
> For the time being, we do not recommend you to use Blazor for development. Blazor's current rendering capabilities and corresponding detail control capabilities are not in our opinion based on customer-deliverable projects.
 
If you do n’t mind, you can pay attention to the current warehouse and the use of our company in actual projects. Our company ’s projects may be biased toward demanding performance. <br/>
